versions:
# append new versions to the top
# The head version is the latest spec, but older versions are needed to keep the ports consistent with the following rules.
# These rules are needed in the case when a single live host is updated across many versions,
# which takes in account running services deployed in various cadence and router forwarding to the host.
# RULES:
# 1. Once an internal port is associated to a service-block, it can never be associated to another service-block.
# 2. Each service-block-<serviceport> has a fixed external port that will never change.
#    If the port is removed from the exteral ports list, that is a config error.
# 3. An lb-block has a fixed routing table that will never change
